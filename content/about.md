*CatBOITAEM* is the *Catalogue of biometric images designed to visualize adverse events and more*. Its aim is to provide a reference for examples of how to visualize data in clinical studies using R and SAS. This catalogue is special in that it puts a specific focus on the visualization of adverse events, a topic that is heavily underrepresented in the medical visualization.

The images where generated by members of the [IMBI Heidelberg](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/medizinische-biometrie/wir-ueber-uns/wir-ueber-uns).
